Machine learning in a 2KB SRAM Arduino Nano.

Upload the ML file to arduino, and establish the connections using this [schema](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/4XZgrmREFiD).
The ML_Learning file depicts the learning algorithm, and some inside ways of how machine learning was achieved in 2KB SRAM.
Libraries installation needed.
